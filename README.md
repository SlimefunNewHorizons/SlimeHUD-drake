# SlimeHUD

Adds a WAILA (What Am I Looking At) HUD for Slimefun items. Can be set to display in the bossbar or above the hotbar in `config.yml`. Additional energy/cargo information can also be toggled on or off in `config.yml`. Individual players can also toggle their WAILA HUD with `/slimehud toggle`.

The HUD lets you see what Slimefun item a block is without breaking or opening its menu. It also displays additional information depending on the block, such as network size, cargo channel, and energy generation. See the [wiki](https://schn.pages.dev/slimehud) for more details.

- `%slimehud_hud_block%` Only block display names.

## Limitations

- Minecraft only has 7 colors for the bossbar, compared to 16 for regular items.

## Requirements

- Spigot or its derivatives
- Slimefun, of course
